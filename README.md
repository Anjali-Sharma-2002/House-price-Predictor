# house-price-prediction

This repository contains a data science project that predicts house prices based on various features. We employ two different machine learning algorithms, Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor, to achieve this task.

Project Overview


Objective: The primary goal of this project is to build and compare predictive models for house prices.
Dataset: The data used for this project contains information about houses, including features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and more.
Models: We have used two regression algorithms: Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor, to predict house prices.
Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
